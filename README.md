# Intelligent Chatbot Application

This project is an intelligent chatbot application developed to assist users with inquiries related to Shivaji University. The chatbot utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to understand and respond to user queries.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping**: Data is collected and processed from Shivaji University's website in real-time using web scraping techniques.
  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Data preprocessing is implemented with the Transform library, and a machine learning model is trained using TensorFlow. The model achieves an accuracy of 94.44% in understanding and responding to user queries.
  
- **Chatbot Interface**: A user-friendly chatbot interface is deployed using Streamlit, enabling seamless interaction with users.
  
- **Conversational Capabilities**: LangChain is integrated for enhanced conversational capabilities, allowing the chatbot to engage users in meaningful conversations.
  
- **User Interaction Tracking**: LangSmith is used for tracking user interactions, providing valuable insights for further improvements.
